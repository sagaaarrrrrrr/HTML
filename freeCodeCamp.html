          <h4>Financing, 1998 and initial public offering, 2004</h4>
          <p>
            Google was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,
             co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated. Google
             received money from three other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford
             University computer science professor David Cheriton,and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.After some
             additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999, a new $25 million round of funding
             was announced on June 7, 1999, with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins
             Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital</p>

          <h4>2013 onward</h4>
          <p>Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple, Inc.
            chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and well-being"
            company would focus on "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases".
            Google celebrated its 15-year anniversary on September 27, 2013, and in 2016 it celebrated its 18th birthday with an
            animated Doodle shown on web browsers around the world. although it has used other dates for its official birthday.
            The reason for the choice of September 27 remains unclear, and a dispute with rival search engine Yahoo! Search in
            2005 has been suggested as the cause.The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013; Google
            is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includes Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft.
            Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in
            the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease
            Internet access prices so they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.
            The corporation's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013
            as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.
            Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users'
            clicks on advertisements.According to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most
            valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.</p>
